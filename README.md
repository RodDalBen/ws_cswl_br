**OSF project**: [link](https://osf.io/rs2bm/)

**Summary**: In this project we explored whether adults, native speakers of Brazilian-Portuguese, could track co-occurrence between syllables (transitional probabilities), syllables' positional probabilities (phonotactics), and co-occurrences between words and objects to find words in continuous speech and map them to objects simultaneously.

**Reproducibility**: You can run all the code using the `groundhog` package that enhances the chances of reproducibility. Moreover, all packages' versions and R version are noted in the script.

**Directory structure**: This repository is organized into four subdirectories: 

* `01_scripts`: this folder contains a Rmd commented script that contains all analyses and generate all figures.

* `02_data`: this folder contains three datasets (`.csv` and `.rda`). One with data from the current experiment, one with data from [Dal Ben et al. (2021)](https://osf.io/s9thk/), and another with data from [Dal Ben et al. (2022)](https://osf.io/6fqzg/).

* `03_output_graphics`: this folder contains output for all statistical analyses (e.g., regression tables) and all visualizations. 

* `04_materials`: this folder contains the audio stimuli, with a table that organizes it into separate languages. It contains visual stimuli (from the [NOUN database](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/wordlab/noun)). It also contains a sample video showing how audio and visual stimuli were presented during the experiment.
